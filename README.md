1. Purpose:
   - This program manages municipal auction bids using a linked list, enabling efficient insertion, deletion, and searching.

2. Techniques:
   - Dynamic memory allocation (new/delete for Nodes).
   - Iterative traversal for search/remove (O(n) time).

3. Challenges:
   - Initially missed updating 'tail' when removing the last node.
   - Fixed by adding a check in Remove(): if (temp == tail) tail = current.

4. Approach:
   - Designed methods to handle edge cases (empty list, invalid bids).
   - Used pseudocode to ensure logical consistency.
